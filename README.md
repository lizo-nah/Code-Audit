# Code-Audit
## ⏱️ 1. Time & Format

- ⏰ **Total Duration:** **1 hour**
- 💻 **Platform:** GitHub (via Pull Requests)
- 📦 **Submission Type:** **Code-only**
- 🧪 **No execution demo required**

## 🧾 2. What You Are Given

- A GitHub repository containing **10 independent code snippets**
- Each snippet contains **intentional issues** related to:
    - correctness
    - safety
    - performance
    - readability
    - best practices

## ✍️ 3. What You Are Expected to Do

You **MUST**:

- ✅ Fix **logical and runtime issues**
- ✅ Improve **safety and robustness**
- ✅ Optimize **inefficient code**
- ✅ Refactor for **clarity and maintainability**
- ✅ Ensure the final code **runs correctly**

You **SHOULD**:

- ✔ Keep changes **minimal and focused**
- ✔ Preserve original behavior unless it is incorrect
- ✔ Write clean, readable code suitable for production

## 🚫 4. What You Are NOT Allowed to Do

You **MUST NOT**:

- ❌ Rewrite the solution from scratch unnecessarily
- ❌ Change the **function signatures** (name, parameters, return type)
- ❌ Change the **intended behavior/output**
- ❌ Delete the function or bypass it

## 📂 5. Pull Request Rules (Very Important)

- 🔀 Create **ONE Pull Request only**
- 🌱 Branch from the provided base branch
- ✂️ Commit as many times as you want (clean commits preferred)
- 📝 **No explanation required** in PR description
- 📌 Only the **final code state** will be evaluated

## 🧪 6. Allowed Actions

You **ARE ALLOWED TO**:

- ✅ Add helper variables or constants
- ✅ Add defensive checks (NULL, empty list, invalid input)
- ✅ Use built-in language features
- ✅ Improve naming and formatting

- ❌ Copy solutions from the internet
- ❌ Use AI tools during the contest
- ❌ Modify test files (if provided)
- ❌ Collaborate with others
- ❌ Push code after the 1-hour window

## 🧮 8. Scoring & Evaluation

- Each question is scored **out of 10**
- Total score: **100**
- Evaluation is based **only on code changes**
- Partial solutions receive partial credit
- Cleaner, safer, more efficient code scores higher
